# Matrix Messenger

Matrix Messenger was an app that I made to practice creating products with real-time functionalities. On todays modern web, users are expecting blazing fast apps that are constantly updating with live data. A chat application is a great way to show off these capabilities.

The frontend for Matrix Messenger was built using Next Js, Typescript, Tailwind, Pusher Js, and Zod. Though simple in concept, this messenger app required a lot of components to be built. I took strong inspiration from Facebook Messenger and instagram DM's when designing this app.

The backend was built using Express, Drizzle Orm with a Postgresql database, PassportJs for Auth, and Pusher Js for websockets and real-time functionality. I really enjoyed using Drizzle which provided full type safety to all of my data. Moving forward I think Drizzle is my go-to ORM.

I wanted to make this app standout from a typical chat app so I added a feature which allows you to chat with ChatGpt. For me this was the coolest part of the app and ended up being the "killer app" of the application. I think AI is an important tool and when used tastefully can really enhance a users experience within an app.

Feel free to sign up for Matrix Messenger and test it out with friends. ðŸ˜Ž
